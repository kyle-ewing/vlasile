### About

Terran bot created as a personal project to test my knowledge and understanding of Java and OOP.

### What it can currently do
* Establish build order based on enemy race (Zerg only)
* Scout enemy starting location
* Basic identification of enemy strategy (Zerg only)
* Construct buildings
* Create units

### Known Issues
* **Workers assigned to building sometimes don't build**
* Build hangs up when worker is moving to go build
* Scout begins to mine enemy minerals and return to enemy base

### Long Term Goals
* Create a build order that can defeat the ingame AI for every race
* Identify and adapt to enemy build order
* Create a bot good enough to submit to SSCAIT
